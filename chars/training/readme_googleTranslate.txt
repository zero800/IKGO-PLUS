☆ a bit of note
Because explods are used in large quantities, it is strict that ExplodMax is the default
Try setting the ExplodMax value of mugen.cfg to around 200

Damage related indication is judged by reduced life
For this reason, it becomes impossible to judge exactly when the remaining life becomes small
If you are interested in Kore please make initial LIFE like 100000
